# Text-Summarization-using-Transformers

The amount of text data available online is increasing at a very fast pace hence text summarization has become essential. Most of the modern recommender and text classification systems require going through a huge amount of data. Manually generating precise and fluent summaries of lengthy articles is a very tiresome and time-consuming task. Hence generating automated summaries for the data and using it to train machine learning models will make these models space and time-efficient. Extractive summarization and abstractive summarization are two separate methods of generating summaries. The extractive technique identifies the relevant sentences from the original document and extracts only those from the text. Whereas in abstractive summarization techniques, the summary is generated after interpreting the original text, hence making it more complicated.
